### Hi there I am a driven and motivated aspiring full stack web developer with a passion for creating dynamic and user-friendly websites. My current skill set includes HTML, CSS and JavaScript and I am eager to learn backend technologies in the near future. In addition to web development, I am also exploring the exciting world of Python and machine learning. With an intermediate level of knowledge in data structures, I am confident in my ability to tackle complex projects. My background in Java has provided me with a strong foundation in programming, which will only continue to aid me in my journey as a full stack developer.ðŸ‘‹
